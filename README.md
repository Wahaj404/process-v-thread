# Multiprocessing vs. Multithreading

Operating Systems project that compares the performance of a generic map-reduce, merge sort, and quick sort when implemented in parallel using processes or threads (pthreads).

To generate statistics for 10 runs of each program:

```shell
./run.sh 10
```

`graph.py` generates graphs of the statistics.
